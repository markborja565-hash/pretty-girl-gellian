                        <p>My name is Gellian Raiza Y. Palamos, and I was born on May 12, 2005, in Pasay City. I grew up with my two siblings. My family went through many changes while I was growing up, but those experiences helped me become stronger and more understanding.I’ve always been an outgoing, talkative, and friendly person. I find it easy to make friends and connect with people around me. My hobbies show the things that make me feel alive walking with friends, listening to music, and practicing instruments like the ukulele. I’m also deeply interested in the arts, especially drawing, painting, crafting, puzzles, and anything that lets my creativity flow.I am currently studying at Rizal Technological University, taking BTVTED–GFD. One of the biggest challenges I face is connected to my course. I’m not naturally confident in public speaking, and it’s difficult for me to stand in front of many people. But my course requires flexibility, courage, and the willingness to speak and lead. Another challenge I’m learning to face is adulthood. Now that I’m in my 20s, I sometimes feel unsure about my future whether I should continue pursuing teaching or choose a different path. I’m scared of being left behind, but I’ve learned something important: even when I’m scared, I still keep going. Even when I lack confidence, I still try. And even when I feel alone, I keep cheering myself up. That, for me, is the bravest thing I’ve done.I have many dreams for my future. I want to explore different possibilities, whether becoming a flight stewardess, psychologist, architect, or fashion designer. My goal is to discover the dream that truly fits me the job I will love and feel fulfilled doing. My journey is still unfolding, and I believe that one day, I will find the path meant for me.
